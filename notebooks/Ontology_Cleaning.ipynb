    "\n",
    "The ontology cleaning step includes the following error checks, each of which are explained below and each of which are applied to individual ontologies, the set of merged ontologies or both: (1) Value Errors, (2) Identifier Errors, (3) Duplicate and Obsolete Entities, (4) Punning Errors, and (5) Entity Normalization Errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Value Errors  \n",
    "*** \n",
    "**Level:** `individual ontology`; `merged-ontology`    \n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:** This check utilizes the [`owlready2`](https://pypi.org/project/Owlready2/) library to read in each of the ontologies. This library is strict and will catch a wide variety of value errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Parse the error message using the provided `ErrorType` and line number and repair it. For `ValueErrors` incorrectly typed input are re-typed.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example Findings*  \n",
    "The [Cell Line Ontology](http://www.clo-ontology.org/) yield the following error message:\n",

    "ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '永生的乳腺衍生细胞系细胞'\n",

    "OwlReadyOntologyParsingError: RDF/XML parsing error in file clo_with_imports.owl, line 10970, column 99.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells us that we need to repair the triple containing the Literal '永生的乳腺衍生细胞系细胞' by removing it and redefining it as a `string`, rather than an `int` as it is currently defined as. This is currently noted as an issue in the [Cell Line Ontology's](http://www.clo-ontology.org/) GitHub repo ([issue #48](https://github.com/CLO-ontology/CLO/issues/48)). \n",

    "### Identifier Errors  \n",
    "*** \n",
    "**Level:** `individual ontology`; `merged-ontology`  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:** This check verifies consistency of identifier prefixes. For example, we want to find identifiers that are incorrectly formatted like occurrences of `PRO_XXXXXXX` which should be `PR_XXXXXXX`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Incorrectly formatted class identifiers are updated. This is a tricky task to do in an automated manner and is something that should be updated if any new ontologies are added to the `PheKnowLator` build. Currently, the code below checks and logs any hits, but only fixes the following known errors: Vaccine Ontology: `PRO` which should be `PR`.\n",

    "*Example Findings*  \n",
    "Running this check revealed mislabeling of `2` [pROtein Ontology](https://proconsortium.org/) identifiers in the [Vaccine Ontology](http://www.violinet.org/vaccineontology/) (see [this](https://github.com/vaccineontology/VO/issues/4) GitHub issue).\n",

    "### Normalization Errors  \n",
    "*** \n",
    "**Level:** `merged-ontology`\n",
    "\n",
    "These checks are performed at the individual- and merged-ontology levels. There are two types of checks that are performed:  \n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Normalize Existing Ontology Classes</u>  \n",
    "  - **Description:** Checks for inconsistencies in ontology classes that overlap with non-ontology entity identifiers (e.g. if HP includes `HGNC` identifiers, but PheKnowLator utilizes `Entrez` identifiers). \n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Solution:** While there are other types of identifiers, we currently focus primarily on resolving errors involving the genomic identifiers, since we have a master dictionary we can use([`Merged_gene_rna_protein_identifiers.pkl`](https://storage.googleapis.com/pheknowlator/release_v2.0.0/current_build/data/processed_data/Merged_gene_rna_protein_identifiers.pkl)). This check can be updated in future iterations to include other types of identifiers, but given our detailed examination of the `v2.0.0` ontologies, these were the identifier types that needed repair.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Normalize Duplicate Ontology Concepts</u>  \n",
    "  - **Description:** Make sure that all classes that represent the same entity are connected to each other. For example, consider the following: the [Sequence Ontology](http://www.sequenceontology.org/), [ChEBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi), and [PRotein Ontology](https://proconsortium.org/) all include terms for protein, but none of these classes are connected to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Solution:** Choose a primary concept for all duplicate scenarios and make duplicate concepts an `RDFS:subClassOf` the primary concept. In the future, this check could be improved by leveraging [KBOOM](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/048843v3).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example Findings*  \n",
    "The follow classes occur in all of the ontologies used in the current build and have to be normalized so that there are not multiple versions of the same concept:  \n",

    "### Punning Errors \n",
    "*** \n",
    "**Level:** `individual ontology`; `merged-ontology`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:** [Punning](https://www.w3.org/2007/OWL/wiki/Punning) or redeclaration errors occur for a few different reasons, but the primary or most prevalent cause observed in the ontologies used in `PheKnowLator` is due to an `owl:ObjectProperty` being incorrectly redeclared as an `owl:AnnotationProperty` or an `owl:Class` also being defined as an `OWL:ObjectProperty`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Consistent with the solution described [here](https://github.com/oborel/obo-relations/issues/130), for `owl:ObjectProperty` redeclarations we remove all `owl:AnnotationProperty` declarations. For all `owl:Class` redeclarations, we remove all `owl:ObjectProperty` redeclarations. \n",
    "\n",

For our monthly `PheKnowLator` builds, we prefer to use Entrez gene identifiers. If you have run the [`Data_Preparation.ipynb`](https://github.com/callahantiff/PheKnowLator/blob/master/notebooks/Data_Preparation.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook without makeing updates, you would have also committed yourself to using this type of gene identifier. If you have not done with this and do not want to use Entrez gene, but rather prefer to use what the ontologies provide, please comment out `ont_data.normalizes_existing_classes()` below."
