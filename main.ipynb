    "\n",
    "5. Save Edge Lists and Entity Metadata. Several versions of the knowledge graph are saved, including: the full knowledge graph (`owl` or Networkx MultiDiGraph `pickle`), triple lists (i.e. integer index and identifier labeled edge lists with a dictionary that maps between the integer indexes and node identifiers), and a file of metadata (i.e. identifiers, labels, synonyms, and descriptions) for all nodes in the knowledge graph.  \n",

This is not a limitation of the code directly, but rather a function of the [`RDFLib Library`](https://github.com/RDFLib). While there are other ways to read in this data, we maintain reliance on this library as it is the most user-friendly for non-RDF users.   \n",
