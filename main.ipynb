    "`full` | Runs all build steps in the algorithm | You want to build a knowledge graph and will not use a reasoner  \n",
    "`partial` | Runs all of the build steps in the algorithm through adding the edges<br><br> If `node_data` is provided, it will not be added to the knowledge graph, but instead used to filter the edges such that only those edges with valid node metadata are added to the knowledge graph<br><br> Node metadata can always be added to a `partial` built knowledge graph by running the build as `post-closure` | You want to build a knowledge graph and plan to run a reasoner over it<br><br> You want to build a knowledge graph, but do not want to include node metadata, filter OWL semantics, or generate triple lists  \n",
    "`post-closure` | Assumes that a reasoner was run over a knowledge graph and that the remaining build steps should be applied to a closed knowledge graph. The remaining build steps include determining whether OWL semantics should be filtered and creating and writing triple lists | You have run the `partial` build, ran a reasoner over it, and now want to complete the algorithm<br><br> You want to use the algorithm to process metadata and owl semantics for an externally built knowledge graph\n",
